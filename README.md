# Learning jQuery
Following along with a [Pluralsight course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/jquery-fundamentals/table-of-contents) on how to use jQuery, AJAX, etc.

In order to create interactive endpoints to make GET and POST requests to, I am using a small FastAPI app in `main.py` (which uses an ASGI uvicorn server).
